# Homework3

This is my third homework project for the UW coding boot camp program.  It is a password generator that allows you to make a 
password between 8 and 128 characters in length.  You are also able to choose what types of characters your password will include,
and you can copy the password to your clipboard with the press of a button.

I built a responsive front end using a mix of html, css and bootstrap.  I made the front end interactive using JavaScript.
